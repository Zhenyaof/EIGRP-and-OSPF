# Implement Advanced EIGRP for IPv4 Features  

## Overview  
This lab focuses on **advanced EIGRP for IPv4** features, including customizing timers, route summarization, query propagation control, and route filtering. By modifying these parameters, you will **optimize EIGRP performance, enhance scalability, and reduce unnecessary traffic** in large-scale networks.  

## Objectives  

### **Part 2: Implement EIGRP for IPv4**  
- Enable and verify **EIGRP for IPv4** operation.  
- Establish **neighbor adjacencies** and check routing table updates.  

### **Part 3: Implement Advanced EIGRP Features**  
- **Modify EIGRP timers** to adjust convergence speed.  
- **Create summarized routes** to optimize routing tables.  
- **Control EIGRP query propagation** using stub routers.  
- **Filter EIGRP routes** with a distribute list.  


### **Initial Setup**  
Ensure the following configurations before starting:  
- **IP addressing** is configured.  
- **EIGRP AS 100** is enabled across all routers.  
- **Full connectivity** is established using EIGRP.  

---

## **Configuration Steps**  

### **Step 1: Modify EIGRP Timers**  
Adjust **hello and hold timers** to control how quickly EIGRP detects failures.  
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip hello-interval eigrp 100 5
 ip hold-time eigrp 100 15
```
- Reducing the **hello interval** makes failure detection faster.  
- The **hold-time** should be at least three times the hello interval.  

### **Step 2: Create Summarized Routes in EIGRP**  
Manually summarize networks to reduce routing table size and enhance efficiency.  
```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip summary-address eigrp 100 192.168.0.0 255.255.252.0
```
- **Summarization reduces EIGRP updates**, improving performance.  
- This creates a single **/22 route** instead of multiple smaller subnets.  

### **Step 3: Control Query Propagation with EIGRP Stub Routers**  
Stub routers help **limit unnecessary queries** in large networks, reducing overhead.  
```bash
router eigrp 100
 eigrp stub connected summary
```
- The **stub router only advertises directly connected and summarized routes**.  
- This prevents it from being queried for unreachable destinations.  

### **Step 4: Filter EIGRP Routes with a Distribute List**  
Use **distribute lists** to control which routes are advertised.  
```bash
access-list 10 deny 192.168.3.0
access-list 10 permit any
router eigrp 100
 distribute-list 10 out GigabitEthernet0/1
```
- Blocks **192.168.3.0/24** from being advertised out **GigabitEthernet0/1**.  
- Prevents unnecessary route propagation in specific parts of the network.  

---

## **Verification Commands**  
Use the following commands to **validate and troubleshoot** your configuration:  
```bash
show ip eigrp interfaces
show ip eigrp neighbors
show ip eigrp topology
show ip eigrp traffic
show ip protocols
```
- Check **EIGRP neighbor relationships** and interface participation.  
- Verify **route summarization** and **filtered advertisements**.  
- Ensure stub routers **do not receive unnecessary queries**.  

---

# Implement Multi-Area OSPFv2  

## Overview  
This lab focuses on **configuring and verifying Multi-Area OSPFv2**, understanding **link-state advertisements (LSAs)**, and exploring how OSPF routers maintain the **link-state database (LSDB)**. You will configure **multi-area OSPF** across multiple routers and analyze how different LSA types contribute to the overall routing topology.  

## Objectives  

### **Part 2: Configure and Verify Multi-Area OSPF for IPv4**  
- Implement **OSPFv2 multi-area** on routers **R1, D1, and D2**.  
- Establish OSPF neighbor adjacencies across multiple areas.  
- Verify **OSPF route propagation** and **area segmentation**.  

### **Part 3: Exploring Link-State Advertisements (LSAs)**  
- Examine how **OSPF LSAs** build the **link-state database (LSDB)**.  
- Verify the role of different **LSA types** in OSPF topology formation.  
- Analyze **OSPF route summarization** and area-based routing decisions.  

---

## **Configuration Steps**  

### **Step 1: Enable Multi-Area OSPF on R1, D1, and D2**  
```bash
router ospf 1
 router-id 1.1.1.1
 network 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
 network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 1
```
- **Area 0 (backbone area)** ensures proper inter-area communication.  
- **Area 1 (non-backbone area)** is used for segmentation.  

### **Step 2: Verify OSPF Neighbor Adjacencies**  
Check if routers in the same area have formed **OSPF neighbor relationships**.  
```bash
show ip ospf neighbor
```
- Adjacencies should be **FULL** for a stable OSPF topology.  

### **Step 3: Exploring Link-State Advertisements (LSAs)**  
OSPF uses **LSAs** to propagate routing information and maintain the LSDB.  

#### **LSA Types and Their Functions**  

1. **Type 1 â€“ Router LSA:**  
   - Generated by **all OSPF routers** for their own interfaces.  
   - Remains **within the same area** and does not cross ABRs.  

2. **Type 2 â€“ Network LSA:**  
   - Generated by the **Designated Router (DR)** in multi-access networks.  
   - Lists all connected routers on the same subnet.  

3. **Type 3 â€“ Summary LSA:**  
   - **ABRs** generate this to summarize **intra-area routes** into other areas.  
   - Helps reduce **LSDB size** and improves network efficiency.  

#### **Viewing LSAs in the Database**  
```bash
show ip ospf database
```
- Displays the **LSDB** containing all received LSAs.  
- Helps verify **network convergence**.  

---

## **Verification Commands**  
Use the following commands to analyze and troubleshoot the OSPF network:  

```bash
show ip route ospf
show ip ospf interface
show ip ospf neighbor
show ip ospf database
```
- **Check OSPF routes** in the routing table.  
- **Confirm adjacency states** between routers.  
- **Analyze LSAs** and their role in the network.  

---

## **Summary**  
By completing this lab, you have:  
 Configured **Multi-Area OSPFv2** with multiple OSPF areas.  
 Established **OSPF neighbor adjacencies** across routers.  
 Explored **LSA types 1, 2, and 3** to understand how OSPF builds the **LSDB**.
