# EIGRP and OSPF

# About This Repository  
Welcome to the **EIGRP and OSPF** repositoryâ€”an in-depth resource designed for networking professionals and engineers aiming to master EIGRP and OSPF routing protocols. This repository covers advanced configurations, real-world troubleshooting scenarios, and best practices to enhance routing efficiency and network stability.  

## Key Focus Areas  

### **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)**  
EIGRP is an advanced distance-vector routing protocol that optimizes network performance using a sophisticated metric calculation. This repository explores:  
- **Basic and Advanced Configurations**: Setting up EIGRP autonomous systems, verifying neighbor adjacencies, and optimizing metric calculations.  
- **EIGRP Stub Routing**: Configuring stub networks to minimize unnecessary route advertisements and improve efficiency.  
- **EIGRP Authentication**: Implementing MD5 authentication to secure EIGRP neighbor relationships and prevent spoofing.  
- **Route Optimization & Summarization**: Implementing manual summarization, filtering, and unequal-cost load balancing.  

### **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**  
OSPF is a link-state routing protocol designed for scalability and fast convergence in large networks. Topics covered include:  
- **Single-Area and Multi-Area OSPF**: Configuring and troubleshooting networks with different area structures.  
- **OSPF Authentication**: Implementing MD5 and plain-text authentication to enhance security.  
- **Route Summarization & Filtering**: Reducing routing table size through manual summarization at area boundaries.  
- **OSPF Virtual Links**: Extending Area 0 connectivity using virtual links for seamless network expansion.  
- **NSSA (Not-So-Stubby Area)**: Configuring NSSA to allow controlled external route injection.  

### **Route Redistribution and Optimization**  
- **Redistributing Routes Between Protocols**: Configuring EIGRP-OSPF redistribution with route filtering to avoid routing loops.  
- **Performance Tuning**: Adjusting timers, bandwidth, and delay settings for better convergence.  

### **Security Best Practices for Routing Protocols**  
- Implementing authentication to protect routing information from unauthorized alterations.  
- Hardening router configurations to prevent common attack vectors such as route poisoning.  
- Using prefix-lists and access control lists (ACLs) to secure route advertisements.  

## Lab Environment  
Labs are designed for compatibility with **Cisco Packet Tracer, GNS3, and EVE-NG**, complete with detailed instructions for setup, execution, and troubleshooting. Each lab includes real-world scenarios to reinforce networking concepts and enhance troubleshooting skills.
